 ## MANKAV Medicare Hospital website
  is a User friendly Website made for Health Informatics and Prediction. It incorporates 4 Machine Learning Models , Each one Corresponding to a disease. The Diseases That the Website predicts and provides information on are as Follows: 


- Diabetes.
- Heart Disease.
- Kidney Disease.
- Liver Disease.

## Accuracy of the Models and Algorithms Used

| Disease      | Algorithm Used | Accuracy     |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |
| Diabetes      | Support Vector Machine (SVM)      | 75%   |
| Heart Ailment   | Logistic Regression        | 81%     |
| Kidney Disease | Random Forests | 100% |
| Liver Disease | Random Forests | 73% |
